<h2 id="analyse"><strong>Analyse</strong></h2>
<br>
<p class="k">Dr. Howard Gardner when he analyses scientist in the field of psychology in term of intelligence,<br>many were saying that there is only one intelligence.
While other scientists they questioned the notion of a single overarching intelligence. Because according to their analyses, intelligence is better thought of as a set of several factors.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>However surprisingly, all of these commentators share one feature regardless - whether in favor of opposed to the notion of single intelligence. 
    They believe that the nature of intelligence can be determined by the division 
    of testsand the analysis. But Howard Gardner estimates that where is write that intelligence needs to be determined by the basics of tests?.</p>
<br>
 <p>   Hoard Gardner figure that the problem is the fact that many scientists was created many test IQ to determine level.
       And If they were not created the dozens of IQ tests in use aroundhe world, would we no longer be able to make assessments of intellect? Many
       years ago Gardner posing just these questions he embarked  on a distinctlydifferent path toward the investigation of intellect.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Creating"><strong>Creating the theory of multiple intelligence</strong></h3>
<br><p>Theory Gardner of multiple intelligence grew out of his observation with two groups: a hospital for veterans where adults suffered from a stroke that compromised certain capacity and children who were talented in one or more
        art form on Harvard.  In effect he was observing the limitations of the standard view of intellect. Because we believe in the classical view of intelligence. 
        When we see that one person of us, performs well in one sphere, we immediately predict that personâ€™s performance in other spheres. He is smart in one thing, smart across the board; someone is limited in one sphere, 
        automatically is limited in all.</p>
