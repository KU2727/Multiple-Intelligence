    <br><p>Human intelligence is very wide and unlimited. Therefore for many years researchers studied and analyzed human mind to define intelligence.
Based on own results they introduced a  doctrine of intelligence. This doctrine says, that there is an only one type of intelligence,
for a human being (often called &rsquo;g&rsquo; for general intelligence). For a long time, people based on this theory, were specifying their own environment.
I also believed in a conviction that all &rsquo;people&rsquo; have only one type of intelligence which determines human being and life.
Is there more kinds of intelligence in our minds? And what happens if someone recognizes other types of intelligences?
Psychologist Dr. Howard Gardner took a closer look to a definition of human intelligence.</p>
