        <p>Psychologist Howard Gardner by publishing Frames of Mind, the book where he introduced his ‘theory of multiple intelligences’ (MI theory). 
        Many psychologists were thinking that Gardner wants to set out to dislodge IQ and standard intelligence theory, in fact,he tried to show people that there is more type of intelligence.
His empirical work with veterans and students form Harvard given him colossal conclusion of intelligences and devising set of criteria of what counts as an intelligence.
As he describes it, <em>&quot;an intelligence is a biological and psychological potential to solve problems and/or create products that are valued in one or more cultural contexts.
Armed with this definition and these criteria&quot;</em> Dr. Howard Gardner (2008)</p>
        
        <p>Likewise by confirming eight type of MI. Howard Gardner he challenged an educational system that assumes that every students can learn from the same materials in the same way 
        and universal measure suffices to test student learning. Friend (Mindy Kornhaber) Howard Gardner's say that "MI theory is a closet organizer. It helps teachers organize their practices 
        and see what is missing". Gardner consider that is better thought of MI is as a tool, rather han as an educational goal. Because there was some inaccuracies by misusing using this
        theory. However many hundreds of schools across the globe have incorporated MI principles into their mission, curriculum, and pedagogy; and hundreds of books have been written (in 
        numerous languages) on the relevance of MI theory to educators and educational institutions.</p>
        <p>I consider that an insufficient number of school in many countries, are not familiar with the theory of multiple intelligences. Schools and Universities should try grasp minds of students 
        to focus on adjusting teaching and move to effective teaching.  Because it is not enough to only have new technology, additional devices and others possibility in schools. Important
        position is to create a new base program, with various assessment, grades for students where 
        their lerning will be more impressive. Other problem is also how to learn, schools do not learn students the manner how to learn and to be effective in knowing new subject. But this is aother topic.
