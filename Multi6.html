    <h2 id="b"><strong>Criteria for identification of unique an intelligence</strong></h2>
    <p class="k">
      <ul>
         <li class="u">psychology the existence of a distinct developmental history for a capacity; the existence of correlations (or lack of correlations between certain capacities)</li>
         <li class="u">observations of unusual human beings: individuals who were prodigics, idiot ranants, or who exhibited learning disabilities,)</li>
         <li class="u">anthropology: ethnographic records of how different abilities are developed, ignored, or prized in different cultures</li>
         <li class="u">cultural studies: the existence of symbol systems that encode certain kinds ofmeanings</li>
         <li class="u">the biological sciences: evidence that a capacity is represented in particular neuralstructures; dence of a distinct evolutionary history for a particular capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Based on these criteria, Gardner identified eight type of intelligence. He also consider the possibility of a ninth of existential intelligence one that captures the human
    proclivity to raise and ponder fundamental questions about existence, life, death, finitude.

    <p>The theory Howard Gardner's has generated abounding controversy. Because most<br>of psychologists expressed scepticism about theory of multiple intelligences,
    in contrast of psychologists expressed scepticism about theory of multiple intelligences, in contrast to educators around the world who have embraced in positive way the idea.
    The theory of MI firmly caught on in education because not only comports with teachers intuitions that children are smart in different kinds of ways, the theory also holds out hope,
    that if favoured ways of knowing for students are taken into account in curriculum, instructions and assessment it can help that more students can be more effectively. <br>    Therefore this theory provided great extent opportunity to suggest approaches to curriculum, aassessment, pedagogy, learning differences, use of computers, place of the arts—indeed,
    almost any issue in which educators are interested. Furthermore, thank to this fact educators felt emancipate to make use of the theory in whatever way they liked.
    MI is mainly based on two words: Individuation and Pluralization.<br></p>
    <p>As we now people differ from one another and Gardner says that  &quot;there is absolutely no reason to teach and assess all
    individuals in an identical way&quot;. Therefore Individuation should be based on our understanding of the intellectual profiles of individual learners. And the meaning of 
    Pluralization is that important ideas, topics, theories and skills ought to be taught in more than one way, and these several ways should activate the multiple intelligences.<br>
    <p>Gardner say that if we activate the pluralization an educational approach it is &quot;<em>reaches more individuals since some individuals learn better through stories, others through work of art, or hands on
    activities or group work-and by argument, each of these approaches activates a distinctive set of intelligence&quot;</em></p>
